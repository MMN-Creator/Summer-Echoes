            <p id="first">Hiii! I‚Äôm Marie-Merciü§ó, the heart behind Summer Echoes. This site is a living diary of
                sunshine moments,
                created to reflect joy, light, and God's beauty in every season.</p>

    <section class="why">
        <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
        <p>‚ÄúSummer Echoes‚Äù was born out of a quiet need ‚Äî to cope with my internship when it felt like I was drifting
            from what I truly love. I wasn‚Äôt really feeling it at first. So I turned to creative therapy ‚Äî a way to pour
            out light, meaning, and joy into something I could share with my friends.</p>

    <section class="vision">
        <h2>What I Hope to Achieve</h2>
        <p>My dream is to create a space where memories live on ‚Äî a place where the simple things like laughter,
            stories, and snapshots of summer joy are kept safe. I want to gather these moments with my friends, to build
            something lasting and beautiful ‚Äî one story, one picture at a time.</p>
